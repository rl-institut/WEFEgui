",isolated_operator_led.png,isolated_operator_led_resp.png,"For the successful implementation of this project, a cooperative-led model is proposed. Hence, the community aims to establish an energy cooperative (co-op) that is capable of leading the development and governance of the mini-grid project. In this way, community leadership and local buy-in are strengthened. The co-op together with the undergrid community is responsible for project planning, development, and capital raising. The co-op owns the mini-grid generation assets and is responsible for customer relations and billing. For certain tasks, however, the experience of a mini-grid company is required, hence, the community seeks to engage with a suitable firm. The mini-grid company will be engaged for the installation of generation, storage, and distribution assets as well as for taking over respective responsibilities related to operation and maintenance. The co-op also engages with the present distribution company (DisCo) and negotiates the fee that will be collected by the DisCo for the usage of the grid infrastructure. A simple graphical demonstration of the business model is displayed in the figure below and indicative roles and responsibilities by the co-op, the mini-grid company and the DisCo are displayed in the table below. /n A cooperative-led model is an innovative approach in Nigeria that strongly enhances local awareness and engagement. Additionally, the community-led approach can increase the affordability of tariffs for customers in the community. It is, however, challenging for communities to attract adequate financial resources, therefore, the community is reaching out to financial partners. "
